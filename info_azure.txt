IAM : 

A Service Principal is the identity that an application or service uses to access Azure resources.
    Created when you register an app in Azure AD.
    CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Terraform)

‚úÖ Example Use Cases
Use Case	Azure	AWS
App in Azure Function calls Key Vault	Managed Identity	Lambda with attached IAM role
Terraform authenticates to Azure	Service Principal	IAM User or IAM Role + access keys
GitHub Actions deploys infra	Service Principal + AAD Federation	IAM Role with GitHub OIDC provider
AKS Pod accesses Azure Storage securely	Workload Identity + MSI	EKS Pod + IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA)

üîÅ Azure vs AWS IAM Concept Mapping
Azure Concept	AWS Equivalent	Description
Service Principal (SP)	üî∏ IAM Role with OIDC trust policy
üî∏ IAM User + access keys	Represents an application identity. Can authenticate via client ID + secret or certificate.
Similar to a trusted OIDC identity for workloads or an IAM user.
Managed Identity (MSI)	‚úÖ IAM Role with EC2/Lambda/EKS assumed identity	A managed identity attached to Azure resources, like VMs or functions. AWS equivalent is a role assigned to a resource (like EC2 instance profile).
Azure AD App Registration	OIDC Provider + Role + Policy Binding	Azure's way to register applications for identity and access. Comparable to setting up an OIDC trust provider in AWS.
System-assigned MSI	IAM Role for EC2/Lambda (with instance profile)	Automatically created and managed identity bound to a single resource.
User-assigned MSI	IAM Role assumed by multiple services via sts:AssumeRole	Reusable identity across multiple Azure resources. Equivalent to reusing a role with trust policies in AWS.
