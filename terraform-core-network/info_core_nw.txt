ðŸš€ VNET Setup 

âœ… (VNet) is a regional resource â€” not global or zonal
âœ…  VNET Peering needed for cross-region
âœ… Creating a new virtual network
Creating a new subnet
Creating a new virtual network peering
Associating DNS servers with a virtual network
Associating a DDOS protection plan with a virtual network
Associating a network security group with a subnet
Associating a route table with a subnet
Associating a service endpoint with a subnet
Associating a virtual network gateway with a subnet
Assigning delegations to subnets
Network Watcher

===========================

ðŸš€ VNET - Route Table  

âœ… Azure automatically handles routing in many common scenarios:
    - Outbound internet for private subnet via NAT Gateway
    - Internal Load Balancer (ILB) in same VNet
    - Spoke-to-hub traffic via peering
    - Basic intra-subnet or intra-VNet communication
âœ… Route Table IS Needed
    - Force all egress traffic to a Azure firewall or NVA
    - Enable transitive routing across peered VNets

===========================

ðŸš€ VNET - Subnet  

âœ… Azure subnets span all AZs within a region
âœ… Subnets are region-scoped, not zone-scoped.
âœ… deploy VMs in multiple zones within the same subnet
âœ… ILB Standard SKU can be zonal or zone-redundant and uses a single subnet.
âœ… NAT Gateway can be zonal or zone-redundant, associated with one subnet
âœ… Application Gateway with zones, AKS with nodepools in multiple zones uses same subnet
âœ… Multi subnet - when you want zone-specific routing, security, or policies.
âœ… create subnet for FW, bastion,
âœ… subnets can have service endpoints associated like Eventhub, storage, kv, sql
âœ… Service delegations: Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups ; "Microsoft.Network/natGateways"
âœ… Gateway Subnet (required name: GatewaySubnet) ; Bastion Subnet (required name: AzureBastionSubnet)


===========================

ðŸš€ VNET - private DNS  

âœ… Link your Virtual Network to the zone (called a VNet Link)
âœ… Registration :	registration_enabled
        - true: Only one VNet link can use
        - true : VM will auto-register A record; vm1.internal.demo.local â†’ 10.0.2.4
        - true: only for Azure VMs â€” not for Azure Container Instances or other resources
        - Hub-spoke architecture	Register in spoke VNet, and resolve from hub VNet
        - false: recommended for shared zones
        - false: manually create DNS records (A/CNAME/etc.)

===========================

ðŸš€ VNET - Azure Load Balancer  

âœ… Azure Load Balancer is Layer 4 NLB
âœ… Internal and external LB 
    - External Load Balancer with a Public IP â†’ does not require a subnet
    - Internal Load Balancer with a Private IP â†’ must be placed in a subnet
âœ… External LB :
    - need public IP
    - Frontend IP config - Public IP created
    - Backend address pool - the VM or VMSS
    - Health probes - Check status of the backend and used by Lb rule
    - Lb rule 
        - Listener
        - define how incoming traffic is distributed to the all the instances within the backend pool
        - maps a given frontend IP configuration and port to multiple backend IP addresses and ports
âœ… Internal LB:
    - Private subnet 
    - Frontend IP config - private IP allocated ( Dynamic or static)
    - Backend address pool - the VM or VMSS
âœ… Backend pools can be NIC, VMSS, LB, IP, APGW IP, Private link service IP 
âœ… Backend to single VM
    - create a NIC in private subnet
    - Add the NIC to the backend pool required
    - create VM with the NIC created
âœ… Backend to VMSS 
    - VM scale set - like launch template (image, vm auth, disk, NIC)
    - NIC mentioned in VMSS will point to the backend pool
    - Autoscaling setting rules 
âœ…  NSG to be opened properly for public and private subnet 
    - Private NSG should allow ports from public 
âœ…
âœ…
âœ…
===========================

ðŸš€ VNET - Application Security group  

âœ… ASG is a logical group of NIC
âœ… Create dynamic security rules (e.g., "allow web tier to talk to app tier")
âœ… Apply NSG rules based on group membership, not hardcoded IPs or subnets
âœ… ASGs in Azure are used in NSG rules, not applied directly to VMs like in AWS
âœ… Attach ASGs to NICs via application_security_group_ids
